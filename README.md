# Drie-Name-Generator

## Project

As a team of two developers, we recieved a request from a client to integrate an app 
that will produce a name. Our client is family oriented and is expecting a baby
soon, so this will help them and their significant other decide on baby names.

The clients criteria follow as:

* Option to choose gender
* Base name corresponding to country
* Name is generated randomly

## Description

To meet the clients demands, we decided to incorperate the following to our codebase:

* Incorperated Bulma and traditional css elements to develop the design and layout of the app

* Developed a JS function structure for the app that attains data from two or more server-side APIs
such as: 
  * Name
  * Gender
  * Country
  
* An interactive dropdown bar that allows users to select country
* A responsive radio element that allows users to select gender
